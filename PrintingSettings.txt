# Printing settings

The accessories 3D printed in this work were created using an Ultimaker S5 printer and Cura slicer. Here some printing recommandations :
- Select a AA 0.4 mm nozzle and a 0.1 mm layer thickness as it allows a smoother finish of the printed surface.
- No support or adhesion are required to print these models.
- Select a gyroid as infill pattern and 10% density.
- Choose a printing material that has good toughness and impact resistance characteristics, such as Tough PLA.
